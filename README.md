## Get Started With Your Own Project

### A new project

To use this template, you must define your base64-encoded service account key in a variable named `GCP_SERVICE_KEY` and your project name in a variable called `GCP_PROJECT` for your repository.

To get your service account key, check [this page](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete).

Next, click the above "Open in Gitpod" button to start a new workspace. Once you're ready to push your first code changes, Gitpod will guide you to fork this project so you own it.

### An existing project

To get started with Quarkus CLI on Gitpod, add a `.gitpod.yml` file which contains the configuration to improve the developer experience on Gitpod. To learn more, please see the [Getting Started](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/introduction/getting-started) documentation.
